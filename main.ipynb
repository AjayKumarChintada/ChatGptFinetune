For example, the image of a classic movie hero waking circles on a screen in the dark can't be created if we're asleep at the time. Generally, one side of a human brain is more active at sleep and the other is more asleep. This has parallels to how people choose to respond to danger or intelligent threats (dangerous low-frequency signals in the brain).
